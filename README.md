# Decimal-Roman-Number-Converter

## Language: Python

This code is an interactive tool (takes user input) for converting between Roman numerals and decimal numbers. There are two functions: one for converting Roman numerals to decimals and vice versa. To use this, run the script in a Python environment and you will be prompted to choose the type of conversion.

1. roman_to_dec(number) converts a Roman numeral to a decimal number
2. dec_to_roman(decimal) converts a decimal number to a Roman numeral

## Time Spent: 
I spent the full four hours on this project
